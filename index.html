    <div class="letter">
        <p>Hi My Babiiii ðŸ’–</p>
        <p>
        There are miles between us, but not a single inch of space in my heart that isnâ€™t filled with you.
        </p><p>
        Youâ€™ve become my favorite thought in the quiet moments, my comfort on the hard days, and my joy in all the ones in between. 
        Even from a distance, you feel close â€” like sunlight through a window or a song that never stops playing in my head.
        </p><p>
        I donâ€™t need to be beside you to feel how deeply I love you. I just do â€” endlessly, quietly, and with a kind of certainty I never expected but now couldnâ€™t live without.
        </p><p>
        Happy Birthday, Zoey. You deserve all the beauty in the world, and Iâ€™ll spend my days trying to make sure you feel just that â€” adored, seen, and deeply loved.
        </p><p>
        Until weâ€™re close again,<br>
        Iâ€™m yours. Always.<br>
        â€” Tas ðŸ’Œ
        </p>
